# SenDev XAF Dashboards

## Introduction
This module adds to the DevExpress XAF Dashboards module 2 new data sources:
 * C# Script Data Source
 * XAF Data Extract Data Source

### C# Script Data Source
C# Script data source allows to specify dashboard data source with C# Scripts at runtime.

### XAF Data Extract Data Source
XAF Dashboards provides with [Data Extracts](https://documentation.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115900/Creating-Dashboards/Creating-Dashboards-in-the-WinForms-Designer/Providing-Data/Extract-Data-Source) a feature that allows You to store dashboard data in an optimized format for data grouping and other dashboard operations. With data extract large amounts of data can be stored in a compact format and be quickly loaded into dashboards. For example queries with large amounts of data can execute and create data extract nightly. Prepared data extracts can then be quickly loaded into the dashboards.
